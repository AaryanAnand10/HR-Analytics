# HR-Analytics
This case study aims to model the probability of attrition of each employee from the HR Analytics Dataset, available on Kaggle. Its conclusions will allow the management to understand which factors urge the employees to leave the company and which changes should be made to avoid their departure.


This Python code is designed for HR data analysis, focusing on employee attrition. 📊 It utilizes popular libraries like pandas, seaborn, and plotly to load, clean, and visualize a dataset containing HR-related information. 🧹 The initial steps involve exploring the dataset's shape, information, and handling missing values and duplicates. Descriptive statistics are computed for both numeric and categorical variables. 📈 The code then generates various visualizations, including heatmaps, bar plots, and histograms, to uncover patterns related to attrition. 🔍 Key insights are drawn by analyzing attrition across different dimensions, such as gender, business travel, and distance from home. Furthermore, the code identifies departments and job roles with the highest attrition rates. 🚀 Overall, this code provides a comprehensive analysis of factors influencing employee attrition in an HR context. 🕵️‍♂️💼
